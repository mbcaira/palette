Palette is an image transformation and analysis tool that allows users to upload images and extract their colour palettes.
The process also creates a new image using the extracted palette. Users can choose how the palette is generated, as well as how many colours they wish to extract from the image.

All uploaded images are deleted immediately after processing.
